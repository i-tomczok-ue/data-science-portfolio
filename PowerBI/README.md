## Projects Overview

### [Project "0" - Mexican Crime Analysis](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PowerBI/00_MexicanCrimeAnalysis)
University project (subject: Business Intelligence Tools in Finance). The dashboard may be a bit silly, but it's also the first one I ever created, so I have a certain fondness for it. Next time I plan to steal something in Mexico, I'll definitely go for a tractor!

### [Project 1 - Global Superstore](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PowerBI/01_GlobalSuperstore)
The report is presented in the form of four dashboards: Overview, Revenue, Tops and Geodata.

*Tools: PowerBi, PowerQuery, DAX*
