## Credit Risk Prediction - Classification Problem
Project completed for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. 
Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

## Overview
This project focuses on comparing machine learning models for credit risk assessment, particularly focusing on 'loan_status' classification. Our objective is to evaluate these models within a business context, addressing two primary scenarios:
1. Avoiding denial of credit to a customer capable of loan repayment.
2. Mitigating the risk of granting credit to a consumer likely to default.

We follow structured approach:
1. Conducting standard exploratory data analysis (EDA) for initial insights and understanding of raw data.
2. Employing enhanced EDA with ydata-profiling, a sophisticated data profiling tool.
3. Performing data cleaning and addressing outliers.
4. Addressing imbalanced classes using sklearn resampling and SMOTE techniques.
5. Training various ML models including logistic regression, decision trees, etc.
6. Evaluating model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity.
