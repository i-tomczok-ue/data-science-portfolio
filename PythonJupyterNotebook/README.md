## Projects Overview

### [Project 1 - Portfolio Optimization and Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PythonJupyterNotebook/01_PortfolioOptimizationAndLSTM)
This project underscores the significance of data-driven decision-making in investment strategies, leveraging historical data and mathematical models. It's an exploration of the code's functionality, serving as a tool for hypothetical investors and providing suggestions upon which they can reconsider their investment strategy. Performed on S&P500 stock data.

*Tools: pandas, numpy, time, datetime, functools, yfinance, matplotlib, scipy, sqlalchemy, seaborn, sklearn, keras*

### [Project 2 - Wine Quality Prediction - Regression Problem](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PythonJupyterNotebook/02_WineQualityRegression)
Modification of the final project for the postgraduate course "Machine Learning in Python." 
The goal is to identify the highest quality and most accurate regression model among the ones considered, which would predict wine quality based on given parameters.

*Tools: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn*

### [Project 3 - Credit Risk Prediction - Classification Problem](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PythonJupyterNotebook/03_CreditRiskPrediction)
This project focuses on comparing machine learning models for credit risk assessment, particularly focusing on 'loan_status' classification. Our objective is to evaluate these models within a business context, addressing two primary scenarios:
* Avoiding denial of credit to a customer capable of loan repayment.
* Mitigating the risk of granting credit to a consumer likely to default.

This project underscores the significance of:
* understanding raw data,
* quality of input data for ML models,
* business contect in model evaluation.

*Tools: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, ydata_profiling, sklearn, imblearn, xgboost, catboost, lightgbm*
