# data-science-portfolio

This repository is meant to gather projects I work on while studying data-related subjects. 
As an aspiring Data Analyst I currently focus on:
* [Power Bi](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PowerBI)
* [Python](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PythonJupyterNotebook)
* [SQL](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/SQL)

Please note that all content is done entirely for self-learning purposes.

## [Power Bi Section](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PowerBI)
### [Project "0" - Mexican Crime Analysis](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PowerBI/00_MexicanCrimeAnalysis)
University project (subject: Business Intelligence Tools in Finance). The dashboard may be a bit silly, but it's also the first one I ever created, so I have a certain fondness for it. Next time I plan to steal something in Mexico, I'll definitely go for a tractor!

*Tools: PowerBi, PowerQuery, DAX*

### [Project 1 - Global Superstore](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PowerBI/01_GlobalSuperstore)
The report is presented in the form of four dashboards: Overview, Revenue, Tops and Geodata.

*Tools: PowerBi, PowerQuery, DAX*

### [Project 2 - Customer Report with Adventure Works DW 2019](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PowerBI/02_AWDW2019)
The report is presented in the form of two dashboards: Customer Profile and Customer Geodata.

*Tools: PowerBi, PowerQuery, DAX*

## [Python Jupyter Notebook Section](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PythonJupyterNotebook)
### [Project 1 - Portfolio Optimization and Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PythonJupyterNotebook/01_PortfolioOptimizationAndLSTM)
This project underscores the significance of data-driven decision-making in investment strategies, leveraging historical data and mathematical models. It's an exploration of the code's functionality, serving as a tool for hypothetical investors and providing suggestions upon which they can reconsider their investment strategy. Performed on S&P500 stock data.

*Tools: pandas, numpy, time, datetime, functools, yfinance, matplotlib, scipy, sqlalchemy, seaborn, sklearn, keras*

### [Project 2 - Wine Quality Prediction - Regression Problem](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PythonJupyterNotebook/02_WineQualityRegression)
Modification of the final project for the postgraduate course "Machine Learning in Python." 
The goal is to identify the highest quality and most accurate regression model among the ones considered, which would predict wine quality based on given parameters.

*Tools: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn*

### [Project 3 - Credit Risk Prediction - Classification Problem](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/PythonJupyterNotebook/03_CreditRiskPrediction)
This project focuses on comparing machine learning models for credit risk assessment, particularly focusing on 'loan_status' classification. Our objective is to evaluate these models within a business context, addressing two primary scenarios:
* Avoiding denial of credit to a customer capable of loan repayment.
* Mitigating the risk of granting credit to a consumer likely to default.

This project underscores the significance of:
* understanding raw data,
* quality of input data for ML models,
* business contect in model evaluation.

*Tools: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, ydata_profiling, sklearn, imblearn, xgboost, catboost, lightgbm*

## [SQL Section](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/SQL)
### [SQL Queries for AdventureWorks2019](https://github.com/i-tomczok-ue/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/SQL/AW2019)
Just some SQL queries/exercises I practiced.

*Tools: MS SQL*
